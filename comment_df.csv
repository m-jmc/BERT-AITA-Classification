Hi from another engineer from a family filled with rage that she has all the talent that the boy was never up to.

As far as I can see, your answer to them was perfect. It was very fair, and if they have fixed their appalling bigotry issues, they would be falling all over themselves begging you to take the money. Since they clearly have not fixed their bigotry, you don't want them around your child.

Never, ever poison children by allowing bigots in their presence. No exceptions. That includes your bigoted brothers.

Otherwise, you do have kids to provide for and it's none of her business because you're not married and you don't share the money.

Just a question: did she know you had a wife when you had an affair with her? Because if she did then the whole 'disrespecting her' is a load of bullshit because she did the same thing to your ex wife.

Secondly, you've made your daughter's tuition dependant on C accepting her apology. As the fees are something between you and your daughter that's not appropriate especially as C seems to be the issue here.

***Have you considered they were crying because of how you were treated rather than the fact you lost your temper?*** It's easy to assume the worst. Children are more observant than we give them credit for.

That your daughter defended you right away pretty much makes it impossible to consider you an asshole.

Looking at it from a pure logic standpoint, isn't it better they learn not to expect anything from their mom early in life?

Certainly, you shouldn't have lost your temper in front of children, but no one is perfect, especially when someone is calling you perverted for being a great single dad.

Your wife is wrong.  It is not better because she is a woman and your son is a man.  Sexual harrassment and preying on the fact that younger people often don't have experience shutting down inappropriate advances, particularly from someone connected to their parents or in some authority or authority-adjacent position, is always wrong.

""Eoin (Irish pronunciation: [ˈjoːɲ], sometimes spelled Eóin, or Eoinn) is an Irish name. ... In the Irish language, it is the name used for all Biblical figures known as John in English, including John the Baptist and John the Apostle.)

Edit 3: lots of people are quoting different ""Irish John's... As above.. I'm aware. As above, searched the name verified online it's used for the biblical version of John ... 

Now back to... With regards to John Doe

People will think it's a faux / fake name.
It's going to cause him major problems with passports and ID as well as job and college applications
He may have issues with medical stuff etc as .. well you know exactly what it's used for.

This could seriously fuck up his life


I think even a middle name or Jonathan would be problematic and I'd avoid all names that begin with a J. Having worked in an official public sector job for a long time... I've seen problems with people's names like these cause major issues that would make your hair curl.

Firstly if you don't  want public answers, dont post on a public popular forum.

Secondly, If it was the other way round you'd be screaming bloody murder.

If he didnt say yes, or move in for the kiss. You should not have kissed him.

He has every right to reject you, doesnt matter how ok you look. If he isnt interested and hasnt consented to the kiss, you broke the basic rule. GET CONSENT. If someone doesnt give consent they are saying no.

It's more than a little bit obvious that when his sister said change the dare, that we knew damn well he wasn't gonna like it. The fact you still did it after that is gross. He laughed because he was trying not to insult his sisters friend, whilst his sister was standing up for him.

You are an asshole for not checking consent after already getting a no from someone who knew him well enough to know.

You are an asshole for putting him on the spot. It doesny matter what you look like, he has every right to be pissed.

You are an asshole because you think you can get around the subs rules by your little dm plea.

And you are an asshole for taking part in a game you dont have the emotional capabilities to know when to stop.


And as a woman, you should know the deal with consent, and that it goes both ways.

And I really hope your friend does see this.

Her sticking up for her brother, and throwing you out was brilliant behaviour. Seeing siblings stick up for each other is great.

Anti racism isn't popular in ""the community"" when you define that as white people of a certain age and class. It never has been and never will be. Dr King's dream wasn't to ask politely for people to be ""not exactly liberal but okay"", then give up and abandon black people and their white partners to the wolves if they say no.

Let's hear from Dr. King about the white moderate:

Letter from Birmingham Jail (excerpt)

By Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., 16 April 1963

""First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;"" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ""more convenient season.""

Shallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.""

You're not just ""not liberal"", OP. You are the enemy of [edit: antiracists]. [edit: uncivil suggestion.] Be a [edit: swearing should probably go too, given the tone] DAD. Get your [attitude] together before you get someone seriously hurt with your wishy-washy bull[crap]. Be part of the solution or get out of the way. And might I add, your parents are who Dr. King meant by ""White Citizen's Council-er"". How many black people did they attack at soda fountains and city halls? How many have they intimidated out of their neighborhood? Have you even asked? Ball's in your court, [TAH].",39231

I don’t blame you at all for being frustrated and walking away, but she’s your wife, and sometimes people we love are imperfect. Try to react with kindness - she’s probably an exhausted walking zombie right now. 

That being said, her behavior is weird and atypical for new moms. I’d have a sit-down conversation, and don’t let her laugh it off - if she starts brushing it off again, I’d say, “I’m not joking, this is strange behavior that’s really starting to worry me.” Make it crystal clear you’re disturbed.

320,chb37s,"I’m going to have to say ESH.

**Why your brother is TA**

Bringing up your regretful teenaged mistakes is a huge no-no. I don’t know why he would think exclaiming to everyone “hey everyone, my sister is a cheater” was a great move, but I get that it was because he was drunk. Alcohol does make you do stupid things. I can easily see how the lack of judgment caused by inebriation could lead to him thinking that was an acceptable thing to do. 

**Why your fiancé is TA**

Probably the most controversial of them but I think your ex-fiancé sucks the most. I get being hurt in the past because of cheating (I know that pain all too well), but  he’s holding a mistake you made when you were a teenager against you. Assuming you’re being honest, you never cheated on him, you’ve never given any indication that you did, and the relationship was otherwise fulfilling, breaking off an engagement over something you did a decade ago is overkill. 

**Why you’re TA**

You’re misdirecting your anger. I get being upset because your fiancé left you, but I think that’s more of a fiancé problem than a brother problem. From your story, he wasn’t being malicious, and he’s obviously remorseful. No great relationship should end that suddenly and without warning, especially considering it happened a *decade ago*. I wouldn’t let this blimp ruin an otherwise good relationship with your brother. Forgive him.",32374

You care about your son's well being and your wife wants her family's bigotry to trump his well being. Fuck that.  Ultimately it's your decision on what to do, but I only hope you continue to be a good father.

333,bkyn9c,"NTA for stepping up and taking care of your brother but you absolutely could have handled this better. I do not want children in the slightest, but if my husband had a young sibling in need of a home, there would be no question. Maybe your wife feels the same way, but you'll never know, because you didn't ask her. You told her what was going to happen and made it into a choice between your brother and wife. If you'd sat down and had a conversation with her, even if it ended the same way, you wouldn't be TA. But you didn't even give her a chance to make a decision. You made it for her, and that's fucked up. That's not what a marriage is. 

Taking care of your brother: NTA ✅

Effectively kicking your wife out without so much as an adult conversation: YTA ❌ 

Edit- Just going to point out that we don't actually know if OP is getting a divorce. He said his wife is mad that he chose his brother over her. That doesn't necessarily mean she's not down to take the kid in. I interpreted this comment as a reaction to the manner in which OP presented the situation. We don't actually know how she feels beyond that. I am willing to change my answer to NAH. She's allowed to be upset about the situation, because it changes the whole of their life plans, and ***of course*** he needs to take in his brother.

You better shut that shit down immediately. You and wife have done a good job and the punishment seems proportionate imo. distracted driving Kills. Full Stop.

&#x200B;

edit: This hastily written comment got a lot of attention. On the off chance OP decides to look back through this, I wanted to add a some comment to explain what I was saying.

1) Daughter certainly is an adult and can accept whatever gifts she wants. I never really meant that OP should legally shut down the grandparents. I simply meant to meet with them and set them straight on the facts of distracted driving, and the extent to which daughter violated valid expectations. Make it clear that they could potentially do some serious damage to your relationship with daughter and that they should stay out of it no matter their intentions. Escalating things by threatening to withhold tuition payment, as some have suggested, would just drive a much deeper wedge between them all. 

2) I feel your punishment was fair but ultimately limiting. As others pointed out, heavy restrictions placed on her use of the vehicle could have been better long term. Could have given her a chance to earn it back and truly learn a lesson rather than build resentment. Theoretically its not too late to do that. Perhaps an agreement that, with good grades, the parents could buy a newer car for the following year. Perhaps, due to her record, if she wants the car, she will have to pay for the insurance.",15494

OP did something we might otherwise consider rude and selfish, but it was justified by the context.  Which means he's **NOT the asshole**.  She was wrong and he was right.

This is currently doing serious harm to your daughter and she is angry at her aunt because it’s not her aunt who has to wear these consequences, it’s your 14 year old daughter.

She wants to take credit for the gift, and with the way you described her, there is a big chance that she is gonna milk this if you let her pay. If she wants to be part of it so much, just let her buy seat covers, air freshener or something similar that's within her budget and could be used for the car. This way she technically was part of the gift, but you can easily seperate her part as ""me and my husband bought you this car, and that accesory for it is from your Mom"". Nice and civil.

Parents who force their way into their teens diaries are shitty parents.

Full stop.

Reading your teenage kids diaries is a violation of trust. They can basically expect you to never trust them as an adult, and to have a distant and likely shitty relationship with them.

They are wrong, and there is NO other side to this.

This situation is so sad. 

You're making this about you. It isn't about you. 

This little girl is 12, and her home life is fucked. Of course she's acting out. Puberty is probably beginning to hit her like a ton of bricks, which isn't going to make her the most clear-headed person. This is when she needs the adult figures in her life to be stable, and you're being a petty asshole. Her bio-dad has been MIA, and now he's showing interest in her life. To her, this is a big deal. 

Her mom doesn't seem to have a solid idea on how she wants you to fill a fatherly role in her daughter's life. And they're both right: You're not her dad. But that doesn't mean you can't fill a fatherly role. 

Your girlfriend sucks because she clearly can't co-parent effectively, this girl's bio-dad sucks for being absent for so long, and you suck for being an inconsistent and unstable father figure. 

You and your girlfriend need to sit down and have a serious conversation about how parenting is going to work in your household. If you can't come to an arrangement that works for you both, you need to break up or go to a therapist until you can find something that works for everyone. Because the only one who is losing here is this little girl. 

Parenting is hard. Suck it up. Get used to being yelled at by teenagers. They're going to say and do things that crush your heart. It's awful. But it passes. And this is when she needs stability the most.",27634

That’s terrible parenting. I hate the whole “throw presents into the fire when kids act up” thing. No, how about you use actual discipline and natural consequences instead of being an Ahole.

A psychologist will probably be a good thing. Not because your nephew is actually going to do anything to the parents, but because if his dad had two friends hold him back to smash his PS4, laugh, and video it, he’s gonna need someone to talk to to know that is NOT normal behavior. If anything he can tell the truth to the psychologist and they can then speak to the parents about discipline in the future.

Edit: thank you for the silver!

Edit 2: and for gold and Santa (didn’t know that was a thing haha)!",20331

No, let them go to counseling. All that happened will be discussed there. The dad is a fucking prick. He made a show of his child’s punishment and even invited his friends over to restrain his son? That’s sick. You didn’t do anything but help brace him for the attempted humiliation the dad tried to cause. His comment wasn’t because of something you directly told him to say, it’s because of their piss poor parenting.",8005

My heart goes out to you, I am so terribly sorry for your loss. You have a lot of healing to do, but it seems that you have a great support system. Your brother's partner will need support as well, and it seems like you are doing an amazing job at stepping in and stepping up.

>Jim made some very racist remarks. Things that I thought he'd never say and he did it so easily. Regardless of what our daughter looks like I don't want her to be around that. What else will Jim and his family say or do the next time they get mad? How are they going to treat our daughter when she does something that upsets them?

This. *When people show you their true colors, believe them.*

Regardless of who was right or wrong - he handled the situation horribly. If he really loved you - or was a good person...he would have just asked for a paternity test from the beginning. Instead he destroyed your things, etc.

You're entirely focused on *your* feelings in this, to the exclusion of any consideration for your son's situation or his trust in your wife.

There could be a thousand reasons why he doesn't wanna tell you:

* He could be embarrassed and need someone more sensitive.
* He could be worried about losing your respect.
* He might feel safer confiding in your wife, in general.
* He might have picked up on some annoyed vibes from you (you've called him down, several times, it makes sense that you might have felt a little irritated).
* You could have lost his trust, along the way, by being callous or downright dismissive about another matter.
* He could be worried you might make fun of him. 
* Maybe he's been told by his friends that this isn't something guys talk about.
* Maybe it's something he's scared of telling you and he needs time to build up the courage.
* Maybe he has such a high opinion of you that he'd rather hide it than risk damaging his esteem in your eyes.
* *MAYBE* he just wanted to talk to his mom, rather than his dad, this time.

The point is, if you sulk like a kid every time he doesn't immediately confide in *you*, you're gonna make sure it stays that way. Who wants to seek comfort and advice from a petulant man-child?",21663

This is not about her being a tomboy (because you gave her the male options too) but about her being a teenager and not realizing that formal events require formal attire and she needs to suck it up (like everyone else).

Teenagers sometimes will be mad at you when you set good rules, I think that's just a normal part of the teenager-parent interaction.

sorry - no rough patch justifies cheating, he should have taken up counselling. He fucked her, he cheated, he should have considered the possibility, that she is fucking other guys, too.

The only one he can blame is the woman who forced that child onto him and himself.

Don't feel bad, you don't need to be mad at your ex, but you sure as hell need to grow up and be mad at the audacity, that he is trying to make you the bad one here.

It's great you still get along with your Ex's family, but ma dude, he made his bed, cheating with his coworker - who was already in bed with another man - now he can lie in it and take care of alimony suits or whatever his plan is.

I hope he can figure out something, because that child considers him her dad already - but hell, that woman stole years from him.

But also, if you are asking someone to stop doing something you don’t like, even if it should be common knowledge not to do it, ask politely. No one wants to do what a rude person asks them to do, even if they realize they were wrong. 

Also, if you insist on watching game of thrones on a plane at least put a sweatshirt in the cracks between the seats and angle the screen so that no one else has to watch it. 

Finally, for those telling the mom to tell the kid to just not look - what the hell? Have you ever interacted with a kid? Tell a kid not to do something and they are going to find a way to do it. 

For the record I watch and love game of thrones. And I can totally relate to wanting to binge it on a plane. In my opinion that is just very inappropriate.",20858

Her entitlement is astounding.

Edit: thanks for the awards, Fellow Redditors!",27189
765,iunsyq,"NTA. Listen to me please, this is a recipe for her to be in an abusive relationship. 

I was a SAHM (step kid). I had no money of my own and no support system. He was physically, sexually, emotionally, and financially abusive. 

When I left after he raped me I had a trash bag of stuff on my back and no where to go. I had $150 that I had hidden from him by not paying the bills that month. 

She NEEDS to be self sufficient. She NEEDS her own money. She NEEDS a way out if her husband hits her. I met so many women at the domestic violence shelter I was in who did not have a penny to their names when they escaped their abuser. 

Even encouraging her to get an early childhood development degree to help her become a better mother would be good. A job in a daycare. Something to help her not be reliant on someone else. 

But teach her the red flags of relationships. Teach her about gaslighting, love bombing, and other manipulation techniques abusers use to get their victims under their control. 

Show her [the hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/abuse-defined/) and [love is respect ](https://www.loveisrespect.org)  

If so much of her life plan is dependent on another person she NEEDS to vet them well. But at the beginning of any relationship, especially abusive ones, everything looks golden and rosy. She should always have a way out.

Edit: Since this is getting so much attention, if you have any questions about domestic violence or if you need resources to leave an abusive situation please don’t hesitate to reach out. The Hotline is wonderful or even if you want to dm me or chat that’s perfectly fine too. I will do my very best to help or find someone who can help.",9327

It is kinda in poor taste considering you do work, BUT they conveniently categorize you as a child or adult based on their needs. Need a free babysitter? Kid. Handing out pocket money to children? Now you’re an adult. It was the adultier adults here who were assholes. They used you for free childcare when they could have literally just asked you do to it. I’m sure you would have said yes if they hadn’t manipulated you into doing it. 

Good on you for asking for the cash anyway. You can give it to your brother if you like, but the point is you taught the adults a lesson. Just because you are someone’s child does not make you a child.",20554
